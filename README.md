# dotfiles

These are most of my personal dotfiles.  They're designed to make setting up a new machine fast and secure.

Steal them at will.

# Highlights

`brews.sh` - install Homebrew if it isn't installed; update it; install brews from Brewfiles.  Includes common, home, and work profiles.

`deploy` - runs most of the other tools.
